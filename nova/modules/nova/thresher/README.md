# Nova 3 Module: Thresher

Thresher is Anodyne Productions' mini-wiki application integrated into Nova. For Nova 3, Thresher has been moved in to its own module to provide the same collaboration tools found in the first release of Thresher. This is a core module that ships with Nova 3 and is enabled by default.
