# Oil utility

The Oil utility is a special package command can be used in several ways to facilitate quick development, help with testing your application and for running Tasks.

## Refine

Refine is a tool that lets you run tasks. You can read more specifically about [Tasks](tasks) to see how they are made and what they can be used for.

An example task can be found here called robots.

```
$ php oil refine robots
```

Not the most useful example in the world, but it works as a useful example. But you can use the CLI class to make things more interactive or just run basic model interaction for cron jobs.
