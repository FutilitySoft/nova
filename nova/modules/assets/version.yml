  While not what we originally envisioned for Nova 2, this major release is a stepping stone to Anodyne's next generation RPG management software. Our focus with Nova 2 has been on encapsulating the Nova core even more to insulate admins from the laborious task of updating the system. With a brand new file structure, you'll find that Nova 2 separates your code from our code in ways that Nova 1 can't compare. In addition, Thresher gets a long-awaited refresh that includes page restrictions, a brand new page management user experience, draft cleanup and much more. More information about Nova 2 and a full changelog can be found at AnodyneDocs. This update is recommended for all users.
