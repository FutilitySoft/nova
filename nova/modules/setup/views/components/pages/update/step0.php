<p>Alright, time to get started! Start to finish, updating should only a couple minutes to complete (depending on the speed of your connection and server) and then you'll be on your way. If you have questions, you can refer to the <a href='http://docs.anodyne-productions.com' target='_blank'>user guide</a> or drop in to our <a href='http://forums.anodyne-productions.com' target='_blank'>forums</a>.</p>

<p>Before you begin, it's <strong>highly</strong> recommended that you backup both your files and your database. At Anodyne, we make sure to test all of the Nova updates before releasing them, but there is only so much we can test for. In the end, it's better to be safe rather than sorry.</p>

<p>If you've backed everything up and you're ready, let's get started...</p>
