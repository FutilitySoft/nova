<p>Every single thing we're doing in Nova 3 is prefaced with two questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Will this make Nova smarter?</li>
	<li>Will this make Nova better?</li>
</ul>

<p>If the answer is no to either of those questions, it doesn't happen. Ultimately, our goal is to make a better product that makes it easier than ever to manage your game. Everything from fine-grained control of meta data to storing every page title, page header and page introduction message in the database for easy editing is designed to make Nova smarter and better.</p>
