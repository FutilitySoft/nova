The module readme files are a place for developers to put their notes about the module, including install instructions (though those instructions should be far less laborious than previous versions because of QuickInstall and migrations). Readme files are Markdown, so you can use Markdown syntax for whatever styling you want. The readme information will be available in the catalog to be shown to the admin.
