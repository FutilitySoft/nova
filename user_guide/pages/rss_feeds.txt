|---------------------------------------------------------------

News aggregators have become a large part of life on the Internet in the last few years, and why shouldn't they? RSS feeds allow news to be delivered to a user without them having to go to the website. Anodyne is taking advantage of such a system and providing RSS feeds from Nova. By default, Nova provides feeds for mission posts, personal logs, and news items.

CONFIGURING
==========

Nova provides several options for customizing the RSS feed. Found in the application/config/nova.php config file, there are a series of RSS config variables that you can change. The following items can be changed from the config file:

* Number of Entries	=> The number of entries the RSS feed pulls; leave blank for all (default: 25)
* Encoding			=> Encoding value for the RSS feed (default: UTF-8)
* Description		=> A simple sentence about what the RSS feed is about
* Feed Language		=> The language code used by the RSS feed (default: en-us)
* Creator Email		=> The email address of the feed creator (default: blank)

ACCESSING THE FEEDS
==========

You can access the RSS feeds by putting the address of the feed controller in your news aggregator. The address you'll want to point it to is: http://yoursite/index.php/feed/posts for mission posts, http://yoursite/index.php/feed/logs for personal logs, or http://yoursite/index.php/feed/news for news items.

EXTENDING THE FEEDS
==========

RSS feeds can be extended to include additional items if you want by editing the application/controllers/feed.php file. You can see examples of the 3 standard RSS feeds in application/controllers/base/feed_base.php. In order to add new methods to the controller, you will (likely) need to add additional methods to the model as well.
