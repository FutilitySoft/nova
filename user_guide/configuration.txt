| CODEIGNITER CONFIGURATIONS
|---------------------------------------------------------------

AUTO-LOADING
==========

CodeIgniter comes with a lot of awesome helpers and libraries. By default, Nova auto-loads several of them we use quite often. You can add and remove from these lists in the ./application/config/autoload.php file. WARNING: we don't recommend removing any of these as doing so will break Nova. In addition, use great care when adding items to auto-load as it will slow down Nova's run time.

By default, Nova auto-loads the following libraries: database, Template, Menu, and input. By default, Nova auto-loads the following helpers: location, url, date, HTML, language, and form. For models, Nova auto-loads globals_model and messages_model. Finally, Nova auto-loads it's own configuring file (covered later in this document). For more information about auto-loading in CodeIgniter, please visit http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/autoloader.html.

BASE URL
==========

In SMS, it was called the web location variable. In CI, it's called the base URL. CodeIgniter sets the base URL dynamically so you should never have to touch this variable. If you find a situation where the base URL isn't accurate, you can change it in ./application/config/config.php. Take great care when changing the base URL as it can cause Nova to break!

INDEX FILE
==========

CodeIgniter comes with the ability to rename index.php to whatever you want. This is advantageous for a variety of reasons, namely if you want to run multiple sims from the same directory or if you want to create a splash page at index.php and point to another page for Nova. You can change the index.php file in ./application/config/config.php. Make sure you have changed the name of the index.php file, then put the changed name in the file. IMPORTANT: the file must be a PHP file or Nova will not work!

URI PROTOCOL
==========

CodeIgniter gives admins the change the way the URI is retrieved. This item determines which server global should be used to retrieve the URI string. The default setting of "AUTO" works for most servers. If your links do not seem to work, try one of the other options. CodeIgniter also allows PATH_INFO, QUERY_STRING, REQUEST_URI, and ORIG_PATH_INFO. We don't recommend changing this unless you absolutely have to!

URL SUFFIX
==========

CodeIgniter allows admins to add an additional suffix to the end of their URLs. More information about this can be found at http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/urls.html.

DEFAULT LANGUAGE
==========

By default, Nova ships with English as its language. If you have additional language folders in place, you can change the default language Nova is displayed in. (Content from the database will still be in English; those entries will have to be manually updated.) In addition to have a language folder in the CodeIgniter core, the Nova core also has a language folder that will need to have data for that language. More information can be found in the language documentation pages.

CHARACTER SET
==========

CodeIgniter allows the default character set to be changed to whatever an admin wants. By default, it is set to UTF-8. For more situations, that should be fine. If you need to change it, you can find the preference in ./application/config/config.php.

SYSTEM HOOKS
==========

CodeIgniter comes with a powerful hooks system for tapping in to the system during initialization at several different points. Nova does not use hooks, but if you want to develop a plugin or MOD that uses hooks, the feature will need to be enabled. You can enable system hooks by setting the config variable from FALSE to TRUE. This config setting can be found in ./application/config/config.php. More information about system hooks can be found at http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/hooks.html. If you are using system hooks, you will define them in ./application/config/hooks.php.

CLASS EXTENSION PREFIX
==========

CodeIgniter's class-based approach allows core classes to be extended by using a simple prefix. By default, CI uses MY_ as the prefix. You can change this if you need to, but be warned that changing this will break Nova at several points. You should use great caution when change this setting.

ALLOWED URL CHARACTERS
==========

CodeIgniter allows an admin to set what characters are permitted in the URL. By default, CI permits all letters, all numbers, as well as ~ % . : _ \ -. You are encouraged to leave this setting alone. Changing this can have major security repercussions for your Nova site!

QUERY STRINGS
==========

By default CodeIgniter uses search-engine friendly segment based URLs: www.your-site.com/who/what/where/. You can optionally enable standard query string based URLs www.your-site.com?who=me&what=something&where=here. The other items let you set the query string "words" that will invoke your controllers and its functions: www.your-site.com/index.php?c=controller&m=function. Please note that some of the helpers won't work as expected when this feature is enabled, since CodeIgniter is designed primarily to use segment based URLs. You can change this in ./application/config/config.php.

ERROR LOGGING
==========

CodeIgniter allows admins to change the error logging threshold if they so choose. By default, Nova operates with error reporting turned off, but if you turn it on, you can change the amount of information that is dumped to the error logs. You can change the error logging options from ./application/config/config.php. In addition, you can change the location where the system logs are stored (if your host has changed it from the default location) and the date format for the error logs.

SESSION SETTINGS
==========

Nova stores session data right in the database and CodeIgniter provides some configuration options. You shouldn't need to touch any of the session settings, but in the event you do need to, they can be found in the ./application/config/config.php file. You can change the name of the table where the data is stored, the time to update the session, whether to use the database or not, encrypting cookies (if they're being used to store session data), and other options. WARNING: changing any of these values can cause Nova to stop working altogether! In addition, CodeIgniter also provides the ability to change cookie specific options.

GLOBAL XSS FILTERING
==========

CodeIgniter has the option to filter everything for cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. By default, we don't enable this option as it can cause issues with passwords that use any special characters. Instead, we filter POST values for XSS issues. If you want to change this, you can simply enable XSS filtering. WARNING: this will cause a pretty decent performance drop with Nova as filtering everything for XSS takes more resources. The option can be found in the ./application/config/config.php file.

OUTPUT COMPRESSION
==========

CodeIgniter has a feature to allow for Gzipping output for faster page loads. Only enable this feature if you know your server can handling this and are reasonably confident that your users are using browsers that support this feature! The setting can be found in ./application/config/config.php.

MASTER TIME REFERENCE
==========

Unlike SMS, Nova is a lot smarter with dates and times. By default, Nova will convert all dates to GMT to allow for users to set their individual time zones. You can choose to change this to the server's local time if you want, but doing so will break some of the time zone features in Nova. Admins can change this preference in the ./application/config/config.php file.

REWRITE PHP SHORT TAGS
==========

CodeIgniter has a feature that allows for rewriting PHP short tags on servers that don't have the option turned on in the PHP configuration, eliminating errors and mishandled pages. By default, Nova runs with this enabled, but if you know that your server supports PHP short tags, you can change this setting for a small performance boost. The option can be found in ./application/config/config.php.

CONSTANTS
==========

CodeIgniter comes with a small group of system constants for working with files and some characters. Those constants can be found in ./application/config/constants.php. WARNING: altering any of this will cause some of Nova's feature to stop working!

DATABASE
==========

CodeIgniter has an extensive list of options for configuring connections to the database. These options are covered in more depth in the Installation page. Database connection information can be found in the ./application/config/database.php file.

ROUTES
==========

CodeIgniter allows URLs to be re-routed. You can set up re-routing rules in ./application/config/routes.php. This page also sets the default controller (in Nova, it's main). More information about routes can be found at http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/routing.html.

|---------------------------------------------------------------
| NOVA CONFIGURATION
|---------------------------------------------------------------

GENRE
==========

One of the most important configuration variables, the genre option will tell Nova what position, department, and rank data to use when installing the system as well as when accessing the database. If this is blank, the system will not install! By default, Nova ships with DS9 as the default genre.

META DATA
==========

Nova comes with some default meta data, but admins can change the data to their preference through variables in the ./application/config/nova.php file. By default, Nova ships with the following meta data:

Description - Anodyne Productions' premier online RPG management software
Author - Anodyne Productions
Keywords - nova, rpg management, anodyne, rpg, sms

RSS SETTINGS
==========

Nova allows people (crew and otherwise) to subscribe to RSS feeds with mission posts, personal logs, and news items. There are several options for configuring these in ./application/config/nova.php. More information about the configuration options can be found in the RSS Feeds page.
