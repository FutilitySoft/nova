## Updating Modules

In the event your module uses migrations, you can simply add the new migration file(s) and have users upload the new copy of the module (or just the migration in the event only the database is changing). Navigating to the module catalog will run a check for each module to see if there are updates. If there are, admins will be presented with an option to update.
