# Frequently Asked Questions

__If characters can hold an unlimited number of positions, why can users only apply for one position on the join page?__
In order to reduce the level of complication with the Application Review Center as well as for GMs reviewing applications, we decided that the join page would only allow a user to apply for a single position. Once they're accepted, they can talk to the GM about taking on other positions as well.
