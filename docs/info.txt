What We Know
============

* Nova 2 will use the same database schema as Nova 1, so the impact to your data will be minimal.

* Nova 2 will use the same password hashing, so admins won't be forced to change passwords and have their users change passwords.

* Nova 1 template files shouldn't need very much editing to be compatible with Nova 2.

* It's likely that custom solutions developed for Nova 1 will no longer work in Nova 2. This includes view files that utilize seamless substitution.
