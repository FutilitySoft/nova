What We Know
============

* Nova 2 will use the same database schema as Nova 1, so the impact to your data will be minimal.

* Nova 2 will use the same password hashing, so admins won't be forced to change passwords and have their users change passwords.

* Generally speaking, Nova 1 templates should be pretty easy to port over to Nova 2. Since Nova 2 uses global layouts, the only thing a skin developer will need to do is to pull the information out of the body tag and put it into the template file in their skin.

* It's likely that custom solutions developed for Nova 1 will no longer work in Nova 2. This includes view files that utilize seamless substitution.
