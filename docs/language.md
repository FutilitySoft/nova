# I18n

Internationalization, commonly known as I18n (a numeronym where 18 stands for the number of letters between the first _i_ and last _n_ in _internationalization_), is the process of designing software so it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. I18n support means that despite Nova being built to support English first and foremost, someone could come in and translate everything to another language without much trouble.
