| MILESTONE 1
|---------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Version: 0.1.0
|
| The target of Nova M1 has been to get the integral pieces of the
| new framework into place so the rest of the development can build
| on the framework. The below components were completed and are
| present in M1.

* Framework
    - javascript pieces in place
        @ jquery
        @ jquery ui
            + ui core
            + ui tabs
        @ fancybox (likely going to be removed)
        @ system menus
            + hoverIntent
            + supersubs
            + superfish
        @ other
            + lazyload
            + facebox
            + simple modal
            + autocomplete
    - asset files
        @ install files
        @ update files
        @ head include files
        @ genre data
        	+ images
        	+ ranks
    - configuration files
    - application flow
    - helpers
        @ building form elements from the database
        @ output for debugging
        @ help with location of images, JS files, and view files
        @ extended form helper for buttons
        @ extended html helper with table row spacer
        @ extended language helper with language output
    - libraries
        @ access library for determining access level and taking appropriate action
        @ dashboard library for determining, parsing, and printing dashboard panels
        @ menu library for pulling, parsing, and printing system menus
        @ extended session library that stores session data in the database (DB2_Session)
        @ simplepie for parsing RSS feeds (version.xml)
        @ template library for using a single template file and inserting content into the template
    - models
    - controller structure and method template
    - globals available throughout the application
    - internationalization
    - system automatically redirects to installation if nova isn't installed
    - system maintenance mode (only sys admins can login when system is in maintenance mode)
    
* Installation
    - the system will install everything it needs to run
    - the system will insert basic test data into most tables for unit testing for different
      pieces of the system
    - the system will insert the genre data based on whatever is found in the config/application.php
      configuration file (the only genres available at this time are DS9, BSG, ENT, ROM and CRD, more
      genres will be added as development continues)
    - uninstall script (requires authentication)
      
* Skinning Structure
    - ability for different skins
    - ability for different themes in each skin
    - seamless substitution
        @ system will determine where it should pull the view files from
        @ system will determine where it should pull the images from (excludes stylesheet references)
        @ system will determine where it should pull the javascript files from
        	+ this might be changing depending on what we need for AJAX requests

* 3rd Party Development
    - controllers set up to be extended without touching the application core
    	@ login, install, and update are not extended for obvious reasons

* Documentation
    - skinning docs
    - 3rd party development docs
    - coding guidelines
    - nova launch plans
    - nova page descriptions
    - API doc
