# IcoMoon Icon Font

With the advent of higher resolution screens in recent years, providing the best experience to users relies more on making sure all the assets in Nova are optimized for those higher resolutions. Using images isn't practical since it would require doubling the number of images as well as a large number of extra classes or Javascript libraries to provide sharp, clean images at all resolutions. To address this, we've begun using an icon font.

Icon fonts are a relatively new trend in web development. Because each icon is represented by a letter, these fonts scale with the resolution seamlessly. Additionally, this combats many of the issues we've faced with icons not looking good on different color backgrounds and buttons. Now, tweaking an icon is as simple as changing the CSS color value. Additionally, any CSS effects you can apply to text can be applied to the icon font as well.

## Usage

The simplest usage is to attach the `icn` class to a `span` or `div`. Additionally, the use of the `data-icon` attribute lets you select the icon which should be used.

<pre>&lt;div class="icn" data-icon="+">&lt;/div></pre>
