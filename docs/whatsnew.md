It's almost impossible to highlight everything that's changed in Nova 3, but the below list represents some of the biggest changes that have been made for this release of Nova.

* The number of login attempts is now set from Site Settings.
* The amount of time a login lockout lasts is now set from Site Settings (can be set to 0 to prevent a lockout time, though for security reasons, this is not recommended).
* Meta data for the site is now set from Site Settings.
* All site content (page titles, headers, messages) is stored in the database for easy editing.
