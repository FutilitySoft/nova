# Responsive Design

The days of ignoring the mobile web are gone. Mobile phones will overtake PCs as the most common web access devices worldwide by 2013. With such a huge shift in how people use the Internet, Nova have to change as well.

From very early on in Nova 3's development, we adopted a responsive design strategy to ensure users have a better, more seamless mobile experience with Nova. Given how many people use Nova on a mobile phone or tablet, it's important that we aren't just tweaking a few key pages to work on smaller screens, but that the entire system provides a better mobile experience.

## What Is Responsive Design?

## How Does It Impact My Skins?

There's actually very little you'll need to do for mobile devices when it comes to your own skins. The majority of the responsive design is handled in core stylesheets and core view files. You're welcome to override those view files and make changes specific for mobile browsers, but it isn't necessary. Generally speaking, you should just be able to build your skin and things should work.
