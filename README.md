## A Few Notes Regarding Upgrading to Nova 3

The original plan with Nova 3 was to offer upgrade paths from SMS 2, Nova 1 and Nova 2. After careful consideration, we've decided to make the only upgrade path through Nova 2. Please see the information below about moving from SMS 2 and Nova 1 to Nova 3.

### Upgrading from SMS 2 to Nova 3

By the time Nova 3 is released, it will have been over 5 years since the last major release of SMS. Given the length of time and its status as a legacy system, instead of spending months working on a proper upgrade script, admins will need to upgrade from SMS 2 to Nova 2 using Nova 2's built-in SMS upgrade process. Once that upgrade is completed successfully, admins will be able to upgrade from Nova 2 to Nova 3.

### Upgrading from Nova 1 to Nova 3

By the time Nova 3 is released, it will have been over 3 years since the original Nova 1 release and 2 years since the release of Nova 2. Instead of spending months working on and testing a proper upgrade script, admins will need to upgrade from Nova 1 to Nova 2 using Nova 2's built-in update process. Once that upgrade is completed successfully, admins will be able to upgrade from Nova 2 to Nova 3.
