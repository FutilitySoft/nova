## Disclaimer

Nova 3 is currently in heavy, active development and considered alpha software. As with any alpha-level software, bugs are to be expected and functionality not available. If you find a bug, we encourage you to report it through the [issue tracker](http://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues). Please don't report Nova 3 bugs on our forums. We don't recommend using Nova 3 on a production site at this point and offer no guarantee of any sort with the software nor do we offer support for it until its final release.

## Current Milestone

Milestone 1

The milestone [roadmap](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/wiki/Nova-3-Milestones) describes in greater detail the development work going in to specific milestones.

## Upgrades

The original plan with Nova 3 was to offer upgrade paths from SMS 2, Nova 1 and Nova 2. After careful consideration though, we've decided to make the only upgrade path through Nova 2. If you're coming from SMS 2, you'll need to upgrade from SMS 2 to Nova 2, then to Nova 3. If you're coming from Nova 1, you'll need to upgrade from Nova 1 to Nova 2, then to Nova 3.
