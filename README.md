## Disclaimer

Nova 3 is currently in heavy, active development and considered alpha software. As with any alpha-level software, bugs are to be expected and functionality not available. If you find a bug, we encourage you to report it through the [issue tracker](http://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues). Please don't report Nova 3 bugs on our forums. We don't recommend using Nova 3 on a production site at this point and offer no guarantee of any sort with the software nor do we offer support for it until its final release.

## Current Milestone

Milestone 2

The milestone [roadmap](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/wiki/Nova-3-Milestones) describes in greater detail the development work going in to specific milestones.

## Upgrades

You must be running Nova 2.0 or higher to upgrade to Nova 3. If you're running a version of the system prior to 2.0 (or even a version of SMS), your only upgrade path is to upgrade to Nova 2 and then to Nova 3.
