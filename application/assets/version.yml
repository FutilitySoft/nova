  Nova 1.1 is the first update Nova to add additional features to the system. Included in this release is the ability to create multiple specification items and to associate tour items with specific specification items as well as bug fixes (a bug where editing existing tour items wouldn't update the current item, but the first item). A full changelog can be found on AnodyneDocs or from the System and Versions report once Nova has been updated. This update is recommended for all users.
