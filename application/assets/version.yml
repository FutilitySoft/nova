  Nova 1.1.2 is a maintenance update addressing several issues with Nova 1.1. This update fixes a bug with the author selection process for mission posts (both when posting and when managing) and a bug where Nova would throw an error when deleting skin sections from the skin catalogue because of a field that doesn't exist in the user profile. Thanks to Patrick for fixing the author selection bug. A full changelog can be found on AnodyneDocs or from the System and Versions report once Nova has been updated. This update is recommended for all users.
