# Nova 2 Roadmap

Knowing where you're going is just as important as knowing where you've come from. We're constantly looking forward at how we can enhance Nova, be it through small features for end users or large features for developers (or vice versa). Nova's refactor is taking up most of the time right now, but we're still looking forward at what future versions of the system will include.

[!!] As with all development information, this is subject to change without notice.

## Nova 2.0

* Per skin image index
* Global CSS
* CSS cleanup
    * get rid of classes with underscores in them
        * align_center => align-center
        * align_left => align-left
        * align_right => align-right
* Passing objects to the views instead of arrays
* Base controller

## Future Features

* Per skin menu changes
* A way to install MODs (probably per module install files sort of like Quick Install)
* Ajax pagination
* Caching
* Automatic update feature
